# CO2-Emissions-predictions-of-light-duty-vehicles
A linear regression model performed on a light-duty vehicle CO2 emissions and fuel consumption dataset in order to predict CO2 emissions of a new vehicle for retail in Canada

*** The goal of this project is to predict the amount of CO2 emissions (g/km) that a new light-duty vehicle emits. A linear regression model is used with a lasso regularization applied in order to improve the interpretability and accuracy of the model. Technical features of the vehicles such as *Number of cylinders*, *Engine size* , *fuel consumption* in highway and in city are considered as training data of the model. ***
